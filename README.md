dcr-sully
=========

Docker Compose 'run' module for running [Sully](https://github.com/markbirbeck/sully).

This saves us having to install Sully for each project.

For an explanation of the thinking behind this module see the blog post [Disposable Laptops With Docker Compose And NPM](http://bit.ly/2tBCYHB).

To install, do:

```shell
npm install -g dcr-sully
```

Run with:

```shell
$ dcr-sully
```

To add to your desktop, follow the instructions at the end of the blog post above, and then:

```shell
$ sully
```
